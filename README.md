Control the Volt meter and current source for confirming i-v property by PyVisa. Keep away from Labview for your eyesight!

Add new classes in the Instruments.py for more available models. 
I will update it if I get more instruments in the future:)

(Everytime when I checked the old Labview codes of my lab with 2K or 4K monitors, I feel I am getting blind. Which genius created such a stupid GUI???)
